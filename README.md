# clippy-land

COSMIC panel applet for keeping a history of recently copied text and images.

This applet polls the Wayland clipboard and updates the history when
the contents change.

![applet example](./resources/example.png)

## Main features

- Keep a history of the latest **30** clipboard entries (text + images)
- Re-copy an entry with a single click
- Remove individual entries from the history
- Clear all entries from history with one click
- Pin important entries to the top of the history (5 pinned entries max)
- Move between entries with arrow keys (up/down or k/j to navigate between entries, left/right or h/l to move to pin or delete buttons. You need to interact with the applet at least once to enable keyboard navigation)

## Dependencies

- Wayland clipboard support (via `wl-clipboard-rs`)
- Build dependencies for libcosmic:

```bash
sudo apt install cargo cmake just libexpat1-dev libfontconfig-dev libfreetype-dev libxkbcommon-dev pkgconf
```

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Build/Install with just

```bash
# build
just build

# install for current user
just install
```

## Install with custom paths

Pass a `prefix` variable to install everything under a custom root:

```bash
# install under ~/.local  (default is /usr)
just prefix=~/.local install

# uninstall
just prefix=~/.local uninstall
```

All paths are derived from `prefix`:

| Path | Default |
|------|---------|
| `<prefix>/bin` | binary + launcher script |
| `<prefix>/share/applications` | `.desktop` file |
| `<prefix>/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps` | app icon |
| `<prefix>/share/metainfo` | MetaInfo file |
| `<prefix>/share/licenses/<appid>` | license |

## Install with Flatpak

1. Add the required remotes (if not already added):

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

2. Download the latest `.flatpak` from the [releases page](https://github.com/k33wee/clippy-land/releases/).
3. In a terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `.flatpak` file and run:

```bash
flatpak install --user ./clippy-land_<version>.flatpak
```

This will install the applet for your user. If you encounter missing runtime errors, ensure the remotes above are added and try again.

## Install for Debian/Ubuntu

Download the latest .deb from the [releases page](https://github.com/k33wee/clippy-land/releases/):
In a terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the .deb file and run:

```
