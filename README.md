# clippy-land

COSMIC panel applet for keeping a history of recently copied text and images.

This applet polls the Wayland clipboard and updates the history when
the contents change.

![applet example](./resources/example.png)

Main features:

- Keep a history of the latest **30** clipboard entries (text + images)
- Re-copy an entry with a single click
- Remove individual entries from the history
- Clear all entries from history with one click
- Pin important entries to the top of the history (5 pinned entries max)
- Move between entries with arrow keys (up/down or k/j to navigate between entries, left/right or h/l to move to pin or delete buttons. You need to interact with the applet at least once to enable keyboard navigation)
